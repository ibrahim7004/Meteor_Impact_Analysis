# Meteor_Impact_Analysis
This is a project from my fourth semester, which I made for the course 'Intro to Data Science'. The main objective was to conduct Predictive Analysis. I used Python to design a front-end in PySimpleGUI, and made use of various Python libraries to implement ML models, AI tools and comprehensive plots.
